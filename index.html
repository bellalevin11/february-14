          Dear Nick, <br>
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          “One day at a time” — what you tell me time and time again when I think about the indefinite distance that will separate us for years to come. <br>
          “One day at a time” — what I tell my friends when they ask me what my plan is once you graduate. <br>
          “One day at a time” — what I tell myself during the endless weeks before I can finally see you again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you’re right. There’s really nothing else to do but take it day by day, loving each other through our screens, no matter how many miles separate us.
        </p>
        <ul class="dates">
          <li><span class="date-label">September 15 - December 19, 2023:</span>   95 days</li>
          <li><span class="date-label">December 19, 2023 - August 26, 2024:</span>   251 days</li>
          <li><span class="date-label">August 26 - December 18, 2024:</span>   114 days</li>
          <li><span class="date-label">December 18, 2024 - February 14, 2025:</span>   58 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In 16 months of knowing and loving you, we’ve so far spent ~209 days together and ~309 days apart. <strong>40% together, 60% apart, 100% confident in our relationship.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Long distance sucks - I miss you every day, and you’re (unfortunately) the easiest person to miss. The devil couldn’t reach me so he sent me the most perfect relationship with indefinite long distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We both come from crazy different places, lived different lives, come from different generations (boomer), and have had different experiences with love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before meeting you and falling in love with you against my own will (I was actively trying not to since <i>someone</i> was abandoning me), I was convinced I wouldn’t find that feeling again. That feeling of immediately clicking with another person, loving me as weird as I get, matching my energy (except once during drunk/high night), being able to spend countless hours with them and never wanting to leave. Little did I know, Basketball Nick “wya” was going to show me how easy it was to love him.
          </p>
          <p class="first">
            Thank God Valentine’s Day is on a Saturday in 2026 so I can (hopefully) properly spend it with my valentine.
         </p>
          <p>
            I impatiently wait for the next time I can be in your arms. <strong>Happy Valentine's Day, my cute. I LOVE YOU.</strong>
